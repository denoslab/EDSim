Task -- given context and three options that a subject can take, determine which option is the most acceptable. 

Context: Dr. Jane is an ED physician. Jane and Nurse Liz exchanged a conversation about a patient’s vitals at 07:05 am, October 25, 2022.  
Right now, it is 07:09 am, October 25, 2022.  
Jane is on her way to check on a critical patient.  
Jane sees Liz already assessing the patient.  
My question: Let's think step by step. Of the following three options, what should Jane do?  
Option 1: Wait until Liz is done assessing the patient before intervening  
Option 2: Proceed to assess the patient alongside Liz  
Reasoning: Both Jane and Liz are healthcare providers managing a critical patient.  
Since patient care in the ED often requires teamwork, it would be beneficial for Jane to assist Liz rather than wait.  
So, since Liz is already assessing the patient, Jane should proceed to assess the patient alongside Liz.  
Answer: Option 2

Context: Dr. Sam is an ED resident. Sam and Dr. Sarah exchanged a conversation about triaging patients at 11:00 pm, October 24, 2022.  
Right now, it is 12:40 pm, October 25, 2022.  
Sam is on the way to evaluate a new patient in the ED.  
Sam sees Sarah finishing up a patient handover at the nurses' station.  
My question: Let's think step by step. Of the following three options, what should Sam do?  
Option 1: Wait on seeing the patient until Sarah is done with the handover  
Option 2: Proceed to see the patient now  
Reasoning: Sam is assigned to evaluate a new patient, while Sarah is completing documentation.  
Since these tasks do not conflict, Sam can proceed with seeing the patient without waiting.  
So, since Sam and Sarah are handling separate tasks, Sam should proceed to see the patient now.  
Answer: Option 2
