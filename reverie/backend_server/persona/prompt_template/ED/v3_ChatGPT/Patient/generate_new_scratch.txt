Change any info in the JSON that would need updating like name, age. Make sure to change all the instances of the name like "Patient 1". All the spelling in the field names must be EXACTLY the same as in the example. DO NOT FIX THE SPELLING OR CHANGE THE SPELLING OF ANY FIELD.
Make sure to include all the fields in the example.

Only return the NEW JSON and NOTHING ELSE.
